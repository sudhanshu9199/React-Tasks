# 🔥 JavaScript, Everything about Everything Syllabus – Phase 4: Projects, Patterns, Performance, Interview Prep

---

## 🧪 1. Final Practice Projects (DOM + Async + Storage)

- 🎯 Projects:
  - Todo App with add, delete, localStorage save
  - Quiz App with timer, scorecard, API-based questions
  - Notes App with rich text and localStorage
  - Movie Search App (TMDB API)
  - Weather App using OpenWeatherMap
  - Expense Tracker App with categories and charts
  - Theme toggle with localStorage + animation
  - Password Generator with copy feature
  - Stopwatch/Timer app
  - GitHub User Finder (search + fetch + render UI)

---

## 🧱 2. Design Patterns in JavaScript

- ✅ Teach:
  - Module Pattern (IIFE)
  - Revealing Module Pattern
  - Factory Function Pattern
  - Singleton Pattern
  - Observer Pattern (basic pub-sub)
- ⚠️ Confusion:
  - Module vs Factory
  - IIFE vs arrow function
- 🧠 Mindset:
  - Patterns are reusable ways to solve frequent design problems
- 🧪 Practice:
  - Build Notification Service using Observer pattern
  - AuthManager using Singleton

---

## 🚀 3. Performance Optimization

- ✅ Teach:
  - Debouncing and Throttling
  - Lazy Loading Images (with `IntersectionObserver`)
  - Code Splitting (intro level)
  - Avoiding unnecessary reflows and repaints
  - Memory leaks: timers, event listeners
- ⚠️ Confusion:
  - Debounce vs Throttle timing behavior
- 🧠 Mindset:
  - UX is speed + responsiveness
- 🧪 Practice:
  - Live search with debounce
  - Scroll-based lazy loading list

---

## 🧠 4. Advanced Topics & Architecture Thinking

- ✅ Teach:
  - Pure vs impure functions
  - Functional Programming basics (map/filter/reduce as pipeline)
  - Separation of concerns (DOM vs logic)
  - Custom utilities (e.g., own implementation of map, deep clone)
  - How JS works in browser (Event Loop, Web APIs, Call Stack)
- 🧠 Mindset:
  - Think in architecture, not features

---

## 📚 5. Interview Preparation & Deep Questions

- ✅ Must Know Questions:
  - What is hoisting?
  - Difference between == and ===
  - Closures and use cases
  - Explain Event Delegation
  - Shallow vs Deep Copy
  - Call, Apply, Bind
  - `this` keyword in arrow vs normal functions
  - Prototype and Inheritance
  - Explain `map`, `reduce`, `filter` difference
  - What is async/await under the hood?
  - Difference between `null`, `undefined`
  - Debounce vs Throttle
  - Memory leaks in JS
  - Event Loop phases
- 🧠 Mindset:
  - You’re not answering questions, you’re showing understanding
- 🧪 Practice:
  - Solve these in mock rounds, write blog-style answers

---

## 🎁 6. Bonus Knowledge

- ✅ Tools:
  - Chrome DevTools (breakpoints, network, performance tab)
  - ESLint + Prettier for code quality
  - Live Server extensions
- ✅ Debugging Mindset:
  - Use `debugger`, step-through, console grouping
- ✅ Real-World Setup:
  - Folder structures for Vanilla JS projects
  - Modularizing code in non-framework projects

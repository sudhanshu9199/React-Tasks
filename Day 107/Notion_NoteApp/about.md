# 📝 2. Notion-Like Notes App (Modular Block-Based Editor)

An offline-first, block-based writing tool — inspired by Notion’s minimal editor but built with raw JavaScript and zero frameworks.

## 🧠 Core Features:
- Rich block editor: paragraph, heading, checklist, code, quote
- Drag to reorder blocks (like building your own document flow)
- Keyboard shortcuts: / to switch block type, Ctrl+B/I/U for formatting
- Local autosave, tagging system, and dark/light mode
- Future-ready structure: every note is JSON-based and exportable

## 🔥 Why It’s Beast-Level:
- Builds a custom editor on top of contentEditable or div blocks
- Drag/drop + live re-render logic is complex to maintain
- Has a plugin-ready architecture (like adding custom block types)
- Cleanest use of DOM structure manipulation for productivity tools

## 🎯 What it proves:
You can replicate the feel of complex modern tools like Notion — and you’re capable of building structured, reactive UIs without React.

# 🖥 1. Browser-Based OS Interface (Vanilla JS Desktop Environment)

A fully functional desktop-like environment built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no canvas, just pure DOM mastery.

## 🧠 Core Features:
- Multiple draggable windows (like Explorer, Notes, Terminal)
- Taskbar with real-time clock and open-window indicators
- Right-click context menu (Create Folder, Change Wallpaper, etc.)
- File system simulation with folders, files, and double-click to open
- Fully themeable with live CSS switching (like dark/light/macOS style)

## 🔥 Why It’s Beast-Level:
- Simulates a window manager using DOM elements only
- Requires custom logic for z-index, focus states, resizing
- Brings together the complexity of event bubbling, layouting, and persistent state
- Feels like a mini operating system with no backend

## 🎯 What it proves:
You understand architecture, window state management, nested data structures, and UI/UX flows — all in plain JS.

# 📝 2. Notion-Like Notes App (Modular Block-Based Editor)

An offline-first, block-based writing tool — inspired by Notion’s minimal editor but built with raw JavaScript and zero frameworks.

## 🧠 Core Features:
- Rich block editor: paragraph, heading, checklist, code, quote
- Drag to reorder blocks (like building your own document flow)
- Keyboard shortcuts: / to switch block type, Ctrl+B/I/U for formatting
- Local autosave, tagging system, and dark/light mode
- Future-ready structure: every note is JSON-based and exportable

## 🔥 Why It’s Beast-Level:
- Builds a custom editor on top of contentEditable or div blocks
- Drag/drop + live re-render logic is complex to maintain
- Has a plugin-ready architecture (like adding custom block types)
- Cleanest use of DOM structure manipulation for productivity tools

## 🎯 What it proves:
You can replicate the feel of complex modern tools like Notion — and you’re capable of building structured, reactive UIs without React.

# 👥 3. Real-Time Collaboration Tool (Task Manager with Discussions)

A high-performance, team-oriented task management system with real-time syncing and inline discussions — built with only vanilla JS + optional WebSocket.

## 🧠 Core Features:
- Multi-board task manager (think Linear meets Trello)
- Each task has title, description, due date, status, and team discussion thread
- Drag-and-drop across statuses (Todo → In Progress → Done)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (or simulated if solo)
- Deep filtering: by assignee, label, date, or project

## 🔥 Why It’s Beast-Level:
- Handles complex nested DOM structures dynamically
- Real-time sync logic (even locally) is tough without state management libs
- Discussion threads per task = inline commenting system
- Built like a SaaS product, without React or Vue

## 🎯 What it proves:
You’re capable of building modular, scalable UI systems with live data syncing logic — ideal for productivity tools, dashboards, or internal company software.
